- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WilliamGarrow
- ðŸ‘€ Currently, I am working as a contract application developer with a broad technology base and over a decade of overall development experience in all phases of the software development life cycle. In addition, I am an aspiring polymath, entrepreneur, and software engineer. So if you would like to geek out over AI information systems, talk shop about the changing role of tech and accountability, or collaborate on application development, feel free to reach out.
